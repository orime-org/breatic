/**
 * `@breatic/domain` — AIGC business kernel shared by server + worker.
 *
 * Holds the business logic both server and worker need but collab never
 * touches: the credit "spend" side (credit + `markCompletedAndBill`
 * atomic deduction) / tasks / node history / agent (model · tools ·
 * skill loading) / model-catalog / canvas-lock.
 *
 * Dependency direction `shared ← core ← domain ← {server, worker}`:
 * domain may only import `@breatic/core` + `@breatic/shared`, never any
 * application package (`@server` / `@worker` / `@collab` / `@web`), and
 * collab never depends on domain. Both directions are enforced by CI
 * guards. See the root CLAUDE.md + docs/ARCHITECTURE.md for the
 * package-placement decision tree and the three-layer boundary.
