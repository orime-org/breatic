 * distinguish three states:
 *
 *   - `!bootstrapped` — the `AuthBootstrap` `/auth/me` ping has not
 *     yet completed. Render a loading shell. Bouncing to `/login`
 *     here would flash the auth page on every cold reload before
 *     the cookie check returned (the original bug — Q3 / Q4).
 *
 *   - `bootstrapped && !user` — the boot ping completed and confirmed
 *     no valid session (401 / missing cookie / network error). Bounce
 *     to `/login`, preserving the originally-requested path in router
 *     state so the login page can return the user there after a
 *     successful sign-in.
 *
 *   - `bootstrapped && user && personalStudio === null` — authenticated
 *     but onboarding is incomplete (the account exists, but the slug
 *     step that creates the personal studio has not run). Bounce to the
 *     onboarding slug page. This is the single gate that catches both
 *     a half-finished email registration and (in future) a fresh OAuth
 *     account, no matter which protected URL they land on. Skipped when
 *     `requirePersonalStudio` is `false` (the onboarding page itself).
 *
 *   - `bootstrapped && user && personalStudio !== null` — fully
 *     onboarded. Render children.
 *
 * Use at the route-table level (`routes.tsx`), wrapping any page that
 * depends on `useCurrentUserStore.user` being non-null — Studio,
 * Project, and any future authenticated surfaces.
 * @param root0 - The component props.
 * @param root0.children - The protected page to render once the user is authenticated.
 * @param root0.requirePersonalStudio - Whether to also require a completed personal studio (default `true`).
 * @returns A loading shell while bootstrapping, a redirect to `/login` when
 *   unauthenticated, a redirect to onboarding when the personal studio is
 *   missing, or the `children` page when fully onboarded.
